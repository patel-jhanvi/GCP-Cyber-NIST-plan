# Spear Phishing Prevention Project Documentation

## Introduction
The Spear Phishing Prevention Project aims to develop a comprehensive plan for responding to and preventing spear phishing incidents at DataFort, a medium-sized organization vulnerable to such attacks. This project designed a 5-step defense system based on the NIST framework and utilizing various Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services for enhanced security.

### What is Spear Phishing?
Spear phishing is a targeted attack technique that involves sending fraudulent emails or messages to specific individuals, aiming to obtain sensitive information such as login credentials or financial data.

## Main Objective
The main objective of the project is to create a plan to respond to spear phishing incidents and prevent future occurrences. This plan will include both technical implementations and end-user training strategies, designed specifically for medium-sized organizations.

## Scope
This policy applies to all personnel, equipment, networks, and processes of DataFort, regardless of location or status.

## Plan Framework
The project utilizes the NIST Cybersecurity Framework to develop a comprehensive response plan that addresses both technical and non-technical aspects of spear phishing incidents. The defense system consists of five key steps:

1. **Identify**: Identify potential spear phishing threats and vulnerabilities within the organization.
2. **Protect**: Implement measures to protect against spear phishing attacks, including multi-factor authentication (MFA) and GCP security services.
3. **Detect**: Deploy tools and techniques to detect spear phishing attempts in real-time.
4. **Respond**: Develop response plans and playbooks to efficiently respond to spear phishing incidents.
5. **Recover**: Establish procedures to recover from spear phishing incidents and minimize the impact on the organization.

## Proposed Solution
The solution leverages various Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services to enhance the protection against spear phishing attacks:

1. **Google Authenticator**: Two-factor authentication (2FA) mobile app, used to add an extra layer of security to user accounts and protect against unauthorized access.
2. **Google Cloud Security Scanner**: Web application vulnerability scanner, utilized for web application vulnerability scanning to identify and remediate vulnerabilities exploited in spear phishing attacks.
3. **Google with Palo Alto Network Threat**: Integration with Palo Alto Networks Threat Intelligence service to leverage threat intelligence and enhance detection and prevention of spear phishing attacks.
4. **Google with Prisma Cloud**: Integration with Prisma Cloud by Palo Alto Networks for cloud security monitoring to improve visibility and security of the Google Cloud environment, including protection against spear phishing incidents.
5. **Google Cloud Armor**: Web application firewall (WAF) service, used for web application protection to enhance security and mitigate the risk of spear phishing attacks.
6. **ArmorBlox**: Event management tool for security breaches, supporting incident response capabilities, including incident creation, threat intelligence enrichment, and remediation suggestions for spear phishing incidents.
7. **Google Cloud Security Command Center (Cloud SCC)**: Security and risk management platform for security event monitoring and incident analysis, facilitating proactive detection of spear phishing attempts.
8. **Google Cloud Asset Inventory**: Inventory management of cloud assets for maintaining visibility and management of cloud assets for security and compliance purposes.
9. **Google Key Encryption**: Encryption of data using cryptographic keys to ensure data confidentiality and protect sensitive information from unauthorized access.
10. **Google Public Datasets**: Access to publicly available datasets, such as the National Vulnerability Database, for enhanced threat analysis.
11. **Google APIs**: Access to Google Cloud services and resources for seamless integration and access to various Google Cloud services, including NIST playbooks for incident response and mitigation.

## Approach
The project approach involves:

1. **Research**: Extensive research on the latest spear phishing trends and tactics.
2. **Technical Measures**: Implementation of technical measures to mitigate the risk of spear phishing attacks, including endpoint detection tools, threat intelligence solutions, and multi-factor authentication.
3. **End-User Training**: Prioritization of end-user training and awareness programs to prevent unintentional breaches, including regular phishing awareness training and simulated phishing attacks.
4. **Response Plans**: Development of response plans and playbooks for efficient incident response, including incident creation, threat intelligence enrichment, and remediation suggestions.
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Establishment of procedures for continuous monitoring and improvement to maintain an effective defense against spear phishing attacks.
